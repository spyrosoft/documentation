* Measurement Scales

** Nominal
	 Just the name that matters, e.g. what's your favorite color

** Ordinal
	 Order matters, e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd

** Interval
	 Any continuous measure

** Ratio


* Variables

** Qualitative
	 Anecdotal

** Quantitative
	 Numeric

** Independent
	 As in Algebra, x is independent of y

** Dependent
	 As in Algebra, y depends on x

** Related Strength vs Reliability


* Spread

** Range

** Variance

** Standard Deviation


* Shape

** Skewness
	 Applies to distributions
	 Shifted normal distribution such as limiting the data to a specific trait

** Kurtosis

** Bimodal
	 Two peaks of normal distribution


* Association

** Correlation
	 Behave together as predicted
	 Could have a negative correlation - one up, the other down

** Regression
	 Regress something "on" something else

** Statistical Significance
