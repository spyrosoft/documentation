* From Scratch Set Up (CentOS 6)

** yum update && yum upgrade

** yum install epel-release

** yum install zsh emacs screen git haproxy sbcl

** .zshrc
	 tail /var/log/secure | grep FAILED

** .emacs

** configure port knocking

** configure haproxy to forward traffic from port 80 to 8080
	 Should be getting a 500 error at this point

** adduser firefractal

** quicklisp under firefractal
	 https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp

** hunchentoot under firefractal
	 quicklisp/dists/quicklisp/software/cl+ssl-*-git/reload.lisp
	 The version number for libssl is usually wrong:
	 /lib/libssl.so.6


* Running Hunchentoot as a Non-Privileged User

** Port 80 is not available to non-privileged users
	 My solution is to set up haproxy and send traffic to the appropriate port that way.
	 It makes sense to do it this way as each website can have its own user running its own instance of hunchentoot on whatever available ports.


* Starting Hunchentoot

** Basic
(hunchentoot:start (make-instance 'hunchentoot:easy-acceptor :port 8080))

** Advanced
(ql:quickload :hunchentoot)
(ql:quickload :cl-who)

(defpackage :REPLACE-ME
	(:use :cl :cl-who :hunchentoot))

(in-package :REPLACE-ME)

(defvar REPLACE-ME-SERVER
	(make-instance 'hunchentoot:easy-acceptor
		:document-root "."
		:error-template-directory "path/to/error/template/directory/" ; As of this moment, this doesn't seem to do anything...
		:access-log-destination "path/to/access/log/directory/access.log"
		:message-log-destination "path/to/message/log/directory/message.log"
		:port 8080 ; This port needs to be available for this to work - change it if need be
	))

(defun REPLACE-ME-SERVER-START ()
	(hunchentoot:start
		REPLACE-ME-SERVER))

(defun REPLACE-ME-SERVER-STOP ()
	(hunchentoot:stop
		REPLACE-ME-SERVER))

(defun REPLACE-ME-SERVER-RESTART ()
	(REPLACE-ME-SERVER-START)
	(REPLACE-ME-SERVER-STOP))

(load "path/to/site.lisp")

[Unit]
Description=Hunchentoot server for firefractal.com
After=haproxy.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/bin/sudo -u firefractal /bin/screen -dmS firefractal zsh -c "source ~/.zshrc; sbcl --load init.lisp; exec zsh"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

*** /bin/sudo -u firefractal
		This runs the following command as the firefractal user rather than root

*** /bin/screen -dmS firefractal
		Screen is executed in a detached state via the -d and -m flags
		The screen which is created is named `firefractal' via the -S flag

*** zsh -c
		The following command in quotes is executed using zsh

*** source ~/.zshrc
		The user's zshrc file is not sourced automatically when zsh is initialized via screen

*** sbcl --load init.lisp
		This runs the Hunchentoot server

*** exec zsh
		This is required at the end in order for the screen session to remain active

** Troubleshooting Issues with sudo

*** visudo
