** After=...
	 Specify space delimited services that this service depends on

** Type=forking
	 The Type setting (set to forking as opposed to the default: simple) forks a child, kills the parent, and allows the child to continue running as a daemon

** GuessMainPID=no
	 By default, systemd will try to identify process ID that is created - if more than one child process is created, this causes issues, so we set it to `no', and find an alternative method of stopping the process (such as using killall)
