* This assumes the use of CentOS on the server

* You may need to yum install pycrypto

* KnockKnock is set up to listen on /var/log/kern.log however I like to log iptables rejects separately

** Replace '/var/log/kern.log' in knockknock-daemon.py with '/var/log/iptables.log' then run the normal installation

** Place the following in /etc/rsyslog.d/00-iptables.conf
:msg,contains,"REJECT " -/var/log/iptables.log

** Now restart rsyslog to start using the new settings
systemctl restart rsyslog.service

* Run knockknock-genprofile as specified

* Copy /etc/knockknock.d/profiles/new-profile to your local machine as described in the documentation

* Remove all chains and rules from iptables (TEMPORARILY) and save them, so you can power cycle your server if you get locked out
(CentOS)
service iptables save
(General Linux - find where the iptables config file is and write over it with the new rules - two possibilities:)
iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables
iptables-save > /etc/iptables/iptables.rules

* Run the following script to configure iptables (or do it yourself - notice that my settings are different than the documentation's - I need the loopback interface to work)
https://github.com/spyrosoft/shell-scripts/blob/master/sysadmin/configure-knockknock

** DIY Note: The iptables settings will be erased in a moment when we reboot the server, so make sure you save them to a file when you're done with this step
iptables-save > /root/iptables-settings

* Oddly, nowhere to be found in the knockknock documentation is the fact that you will lock yourself out of your server once the knockknock iptables rules are in place and you rboot your server

** Copy (found in this repository under this same directory) knockknock.service to /etc/systemd/system/

* BE SURE TO TEST THAT THIS IS WORKING
(server)
systemctl start knockknock.service
systemctl status knockknock.service
(make sure it's running and everything's good)
(local)
ssh root@example.com

* If you can't get in, something is horribly wrong - fix whatever is wrong with iptables before you continue

(server)
systemctl enable knockknock.service
reboot
(local)
ssh root@example.com
(server)
systemctl status knockknock.service
(make sure it's running and everything's good)

* Now that we know that knockknock.service works on boot, run the configure-knockknock script again, and this time save iptables to disk
(server)
/root/configure-knockknock
service iptables save
(or the other way mentioned above)

* Reboot the server and log back in - now you're using knockknock - yay
