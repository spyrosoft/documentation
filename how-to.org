* Answers

** Comment Region (M-x comment-region) sucks - it does not use block comments - is there a way to do this?
	 Just use M-; - it comments each line, but that's not so bad

** Change the gui theme
   There is a solarized theme on github, but it looks like a lot of work

** How to prevent emacs from adding newlines at the end of files?
   It doesn't, other than the .emacs files when appending lines

** Jump point up to the first ocurrance of _ character

   C-s CHAR then navigation or deletion command

** Stop emacs from making #filename# files

   (setq make-backup-files nil)
   (setq auto-save-default nil)

** Highlight/jump to paired delimiter
   C-M-n
   C-M-p

** View the current value of a variable
   C-h v <VARIABLE>

** Set up default character encoding and newlines
   C-h C
   The default system encoding is used by default for new files - it does what you would want

** See if the tab issue can be fixed by defining tab width in Terminator
   Tabs are displayed as a certain width by using literal spaces in the terminal. The number of which can be changed by visiting `M-x describe-variable tab-width' and clicking Customize - changes go into the .emacs config file.


* Give Up

** Reset emacs modes to default
