** How to prevent emacs from adding newlines at the end of files?
   It doesn't, other than the .emacs files when appending lines

** Jump point up to the first ocurrance of _ character

   C-s CHAR then navigation or deletion command

** Stop emacs from making #filename# files

   (setq make-backup-files nil)
   (setq auto-save-default nil)

   C-M-n
   C-M-p

** View the current value of a variable
   C-h v <VARIABLE>

   The default system encoding is used by default for new files - it does what you would want

** See if the tab issue can be fixed by defining tab width in Terminator
   Tabs are displayed as a certain width by using literal spaces in the terminal. The number of which can be changed by visiting `M-x describe-variable tab-width' and clicking Customize - changes go into the .emacs config file.
